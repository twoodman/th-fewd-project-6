- ~~Replace dogs with SVG images of the same size using the img tag.~~ ***SEE E.E. REQUIREMENT BELOW***
- ~~Change menu icons to svg | keep original image size~~ done
- ~~Change nav menu item SVG and text on hover with CSS~~ done
- ~~Only use an ID once, if at all~~ done | removed all IDs
- ~~Refactor to Sass/Compass?~~ done
- ~~Make comments in CSS(?) showing which browsers tested on. Will also put in this README~~ done
- ~~Validate HTML/CSS~~ done | first val: all except one error were fill errors, forgot to remove 'padding: 0 auto;' when I was toying around
